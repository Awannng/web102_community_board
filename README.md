## Notes

This helped me to refresh my knowledge on React, CSS and JSX. I also learned some tricks along the way as rounding the picture, you can round only the top 2 corners. 
And when importing images, we can right click the image, find "Copy Relative Path" to have the right acces to the images in the folder.
